# Waffle
Simple and small language that I created to learn about creating backends and register allocation. Currently this compiler got only one backend: Cranelift.
I want to create my own small IR and assember for learning purposes and use that IR in this compiler.

# What backend use?
Most finished backend in C backend. If you want fast compilation and JIT execution you could use Cranelift backend,but that backend still WIP.
